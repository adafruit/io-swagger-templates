# Adafruit IO Swagger Codegen Templates
This repository contains [Swagger Codegen][1] templates. The templates are used to generate the open source Adafruit IO server and clients from the [Adafruit IO Swagger REST documentation][2]. Code generation is kind of sketchy, but it will save a bunch of development time on the open source server, and will allow us to easily update the server and client libs when the API changes.

## Build Instructions
The easiest way to use Swagger Codegen is to use [the docker container][3].
